1. The user clicks on a crewmate to select them and clicks on a target room.

The main scene reacts to the first click by giving it to the crew visualizer, 
which then sets itself to be selected. The second click is given to the crew
visualizer, which sets the crew member's selected room to be the target room.

2. A ship attacks another ship with a weapon.
